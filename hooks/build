# Docker Hub Automated Build Hook
#
# This script is automatically executed by Docker Hub's Automated Build system
# when code is pushed to the connected GitHub repository. Docker Hub provides
# the following environment variables:
#   - SOURCE_BRANCH: The git branch being built (e.g., "main", "develop")
#   - SOURCE_COMMIT: The git commit hash (short format)
#   - IMAGE_NAME: The name of the Docker image being built
#   - DOCKER_REPO: The Docker Hub repository path (e.g., "seebruecke/bside-website")
#
# Additional environment variables (PAYLOAD_URL_*, FRONTEND_URL_*, etc.) are
# configured in the Docker Hub repository settings and injected during build.
# 
# Docker Hub is configured to only trigger builds for 'main' and 'dev' branches.
